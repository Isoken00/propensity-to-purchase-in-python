# Build Customer's Propensity to Purchase Model in Python
## Project Description
This project is about a startup e-commerce business that offers a wide range of goods, from luxury gadgets and home appliances to everyday necessities like dairy and veggies. As a one-year-old business, they have seen a lot of individuals visit their platform in search of products, but very few actually make a purchase.

The company intends to send users discounts or coupons to encourage them to make a purchase in order to increase the number of sales. However, as a startup in its early stages, they have a tight budget for this promo. They have therefore contacted my team in an attempt to get our assistance in developing a model that would forecast each user's likelihood of making a purchase.

For this, propensity modeling will be utilized. A group of techniques known as "propensity modeling" are used to create predictive models that use historical data to predict the behavior of a target audience. In other words, propensity models aid in determining the probability that an individual will carry out a specific activity. Then, we may utilize this probability or likelihood score to create personalized targeting campaigns for the users thus reducing our total cost (targeting only a small set of users) and increasing our ROI.

We'll also employ RFM Modeling to aid in our propensity to purchase prediction. RFM is a data-driven consumer segmentation strategy that gives marketers the power to decide with knowledge. Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value—abbreviated RFM—all relate to important characteristics of the client. Because frequency and monetary value impact a customer's lifetime value and recency influences retention, a gauge of engagement, these RFM metrics are significant indications of a customer's behavior.

It enables marketers to target users with unique and tailored marketing tactics by rapidly identifying and segmenting them into homogeneous groups. Consequently, this enhances user retention and engagement. Using the propensity modeling likelihood scores, the marketing team can narrow the user base to just include those who truly require the push (in terms of discounts or coupons) to make a purchase rather than sending coupons to users who would have bought the product anyway.

## The Dataset
The dataset contains the purchase history of various users over a period of time for the e-commerce company.
